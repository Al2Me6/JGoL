# (More Sane) Project Plan

## Problem

The goal of the project is to implement John Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in Java. It is a zero-player game, where everything is determined by the initial state, requiring no further input. Game of Life serves as a model for cellular automation, where sets of rules determines the creation and destruction of cells in a grid.

The game is created on a grid (i.e. the board), where cells are generated and destroyed based on four simple cases:

* Any live cell with one or no neighbors dies from solitude (removed from grid)
* Any live cell with 4+ neighbors dies by overpopulation (removed from grid)
* Any live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives (remains the same in grid)
* Any empty cell with three neighbors is populated (added to the grid)

For each generation, the game iterates through each cell on the board, applies the four preceding rules, and change the state of the cells accordingly.

At the very beginning, the user will choose the initially populated cells using the UI by clicking on specific cells in the grid, which will then turn black to indicate that the cell is alive (a dead cell is white). Then, the user will click a button to indicate that they are done with the initial layout. The user will then be presented with buttons to go to the next generation and to clear. The user may clear the board at any time and restart.

## Examples

| Initial state |  Next state | Explanation |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |
|               |             |             |

        pack ui using ui.pack() (inherited from JFrame)
        make ui visible
